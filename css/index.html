        <h4 class="title-song">Bed Chem</h4>
        <p>I was in a sheer dress the day that we met
            We were both in a rush, we talked for a sec
            Your friend hit me so we could connect
            And what are the odds? You sent me a text
            And now the next thing I know, I'm like
            Manifest that you're oversized
            I digress, got me scrollin' like
            Out of breath, got me goin' like</p>


        <p id="parrafo-uno">Ooh (ah)
            Who's the cute boy with the white jacket and the thick accent? Like
            Ooh (ah)
            Maybe it's all in my head
            But I bet we'd have really good bed chem
            
            How you pick me up, pull me down, turn me 'round, oh, it just makes sense
            How you talk so sweet when you're doin' bad things, that's bed (bed) chem (chem)
            How you're lookin' at me, yeah, I know what that means and I'm obsessed
            Are you free next week? I'd bet we'd have really good</p>

        <p class="texto-32">Come right on me
            I mean, camaraderie
            Said you're not in my timezone, but you wanna be
            Where art thou? Why not uponeth me?
            See it in my mind, let's fulfill the prophecy
            
            Ooh (ah)
            Who's the cute guy with the wide, blue eyes and the big bad, mmm, like?
            Ooh (ah)
            I know it sound a bit redundant
            But I bet we'd have really good bed chem
            
            How you pick me up, pull me down, turn me 'round, oh, it just makes sense (just makes sense)
            How you talk so sweet when you're doin' bad things, that's bed chem (oh, that's bed chem)
            How you're lookin' at me, yeah, I know what that means and I'm obsessed (so obsessed)
            Are you free next week? I'd bet we'd have really good (bed chem)</p>

            <p>And I bet we'd both arrive at the same time (bed chem)
                And I bet the thermostat's set at six-nine (bed che', chem)
                And I bet it's even better than in my head (my, ooh)
                
                How you pick me up, pull me down, turn me 'round, oh, it just makes sense (just makes sense)
                How you talk so sweet when you're doin' bad things, that's bed chem (oh, that's bed chem)
                How you're lookin' at me, yeah, I know what that means and I'm obsessed (so obsessed)
                Are you free next week? (Are you free next week?) I'd bet we'd have really good
                
                Hah (make me go), hah
                No, no, no
                Hah (make me go), hah
                No, no, no, no, oh, no, oh
                Hah (make me go), hah (yeah, yeah)
                No, no, no, oh
                Hah (make me go), hah
                Ooh, oh, babe
